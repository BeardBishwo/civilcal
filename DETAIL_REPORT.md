## 🔄 How It All Works Together

### 1. User Request Flow
1. **User visits URL** (e.g., `bishwo_calculator.test/civil`)
2. **`.htaccess`** routes to `index.php` (clean URLs)
3. **`index.php`** loads the application bootstrap
4. **Router** maps URL to `CivilController`
5. **Controller** uses models to get data
6. **Controller** renders view with theme
7. **ThemeManager** provides neon styling
8. **Response sent to user**

### 2. Calculation Process
1. **User selects calculator** from engineering category
2. **Controller loads** specific calculation form
3. **User inputs parameters** and submits
4. **Controller validates** input using Security service
5. **Model performs** engineering calculations
6. **Results stored** in database
7. **Report generated** using mPDF library
8. **User can view, save, or export** results

### 3. Authentication System
1. **User registers** through AuthController
2. **Security service** hashes and stores password
3. **User logs in** with email/password
4. **Session created** and managed
5. **Controllers check** authentication status
6. **Protected pages** require login
7. **Admin users** get additional permissions
