Structural Design,"A column with a slenderness ratio greater than 12 is called a ""Long Column"".",TRUE,It is prone to buckling failure.
Structural Design,Deformed bars (Tor steel) provide better bond with concrete than plain bars.,TRUE,The ribs/lugs on the surface increase grip (bond).
Structural Design,The neutral axis is the layer where stress is zero.,TRUE,"Compression is on one side, Tension on the other; NA has zero stress."
Structural Design,Dead Load is the weight of movable furniture and people.,FALSE,That is Live Load. Dead Load is the weight of the structure itself.
Soil Mechanics,"""Void Ratio"" (e) can be greater than 1.",TRUE,"Volume of voids can be larger than volume of solids (e.g., loose clay)."
Soil Mechanics,"""Porosity"" (n) can be greater than 100%.",FALSE,Porosity is Volume of Voids / Total Volume. It can never exceed 100% (or 1.0).
Soil Mechanics,Darcy’s Law assumes the flow of water through soil is Turbulent.,FALSE,It assumes the flow is Laminar.
Soil Mechanics,Gravel is more permeable than Clay.,TRUE,Water passes through gravel easily; Clay acts as a barrier.
Soil Mechanics,"The ""Plasticity Index"" (PI) is Liquid Limit minus Plastic Limit.",TRUE,PI=LL−PL.
Soil Mechanics,"""Compaction"" expels water from the soil pores.",FALSE,"Compaction expels Air. ""Consolidation"" expels Water."
Soil Mechanics,The ultimate bearing capacity is the load at which soil fails.,TRUE,It is the maximum pressure the soil can support.
Soil Mechanics,Black Cotton Soil is excellent for building foundations.,FALSE,It is dangerous due to high swelling and shrinkage characteristics.
Soil Mechanics,"A ""Pycnometer"" is used to determine the Specific Gravity of soil.",TRUE,It is a standard lab test for specific gravity.
Soil Mechanics,Rankine’s theory is used to calculate earth pressure on retaining walls.,TRUE,It calculates Active and Passive earth pressure.
Irrigation Eng.,"""Duty"" is measured in hectares per cumec.",TRUE,It represents the area irrigated by one unit of discharge.
Irrigation Eng.,"""Delta"" denotes the time period of the crop.",FALSE,"Delta (Δ) is the total depth of water applied. Time is ""Base Period""."
Irrigation Eng.,Drip irrigation has higher water efficiency than Sprinkler irrigation.,TRUE,Drip minimizes evaporation and runoff by applying water to roots.
Irrigation Eng.,"A ""Weir"" is a structure used to store water.",FALSE,A Weir raises water level to divert it; a Dam stores water.
Irrigation Eng.,"""Perennial Irrigation"" means supplying water throughout the year.",TRUE,"As opposed to ""Inundation"" (seasonal flood) irrigation."
Irrigation Eng.,"An ""Aqueduct"" carries a canal below a drainage.",FALSE,"In an Aqueduct, the canal passes over (above) the drainage."
Irrigation Eng.,"The ""Base Period"" is the time between first watering and last watering.",TRUE,It is slightly shorter than the Crop Period.
Irrigation Eng.,Lining of canals is done to increase seepage losses.,FALSE,Lining is done to reduce seepage losses and increase velocity.
Irrigation Eng.,"""Waterlogging"" makes the land more fertile.",FALSE,Waterlogging brings salts to the surface (salinity) and ruins fertility.
Irrigation Eng.,"A ""Divide Wall"" separates the weir from the under-sluices.",TRUE,It creates a pocket for silt control in front of the canal head regulator.
Estimating & Costing,The unit of measurement for Earthwork in excavation is Square Meter (m2).,FALSE,Earthwork is measured in Cubic Meters (m3).
Estimating & Costing,1 Bag of Cement weighs 50 kg.,TRUE,This is the standard commercial weight.
Estimating & Costing,"""Contingencies"" are usually added at 3% to 5% of the estimated cost.",TRUE,To cover unforeseen expenses.
Estimating & Costing,Brick partition walls (half-brick thick) are measured in running meters.,FALSE,They are usually measured in Square Meters (m2).
Estimating & Costing,"""Scrap Value"" is the value of a dismantled material.",TRUE,"The value of ""junk"" after the building is pulled down."
Estimating & Costing,"A ""Revised Estimate"" is prepared when the original estimate is exceeded by 5%.",TRUE,It is required if costs deviate significantly.
Estimating & Costing,The density of mild steel is 7850 kg/m3.,TRUE,A standard value used in estimation.
Estimating & Costing,"""Plinth Area"" includes the area of the courtyard.",FALSE,Plinth area is the covered area; open courtyards are excluded.
Estimating & Costing,Painting works are measured in Cubic Meters.,FALSE,Painting is measured in Square Meters (m2) (Surface area).
Estimating & Costing,"""Lead"" refers to the horizontal distance materials are carried.",TRUE,"""Lift"" is the vertical distance."
Const. Management,"The ""Critical Path"" is the shortest path in a network diagram.",FALSE,The Critical Path is the Longest path in time (determines project duration).
Const. Management,"A ""Bar Chart"" is also known as a Gantt Chart.",TRUE,Named after Henry Gantt.
Const. Management,"""Earnest Money"" is deposited by the contractor after winning the bid.",FALSE,"It is deposited with the tender (bid) to show seriousness. ""Security Deposit"" is after winning."
