Concrete Technology,Curing of concrete can be stopped after 2 days.,FALSE,Curing requires at least 7 to 28 days for proper hydration.
Concrete Technology,"""Bulking of sand"" occurs due to moisture content.",TRUE,"Surface moisture pushes particles apart, increasing volume."
Concrete Technology,Calcium Chloride (CaCl₂) is used as a retarder in concrete.,FALSE,It is an Accelerator (speeds up setting). Gypsum is a retarder.
Concrete Technology,Vibrators are used to remove entrapped air from concrete.,TRUE,This process is called compaction.
Water Supply,Hard water forms lather easily with soap.,FALSE,Hard water consumes soap and does not form lather easily.
Water Supply,The pH value of neutral water is 7.,TRUE,"< 7 is acidic, > 7 is alkaline."
Water Supply,Alum is used in water treatment for disinfection.,FALSE,Alum is used for Coagulation (settling particles). Chlorine is for disinfection.
Water Supply,Groundwater is generally free from suspended impurities compared to river water.,TRUE,The soil layers act as a natural filter.
Water Supply,"A ""Check Valve"" allows water to flow in both directions.",FALSE,A check (reflux) valve allows flow in only one direction.
Water Supply,The Grid Iron system of pipe layout has more dead ends than the Tree system.,FALSE,The Tree (Dead End) system has the most dead ends. Grid Iron allows circulation.
Water Supply,Residual chlorine in water is harmful and must be zero.,FALSE,A small amount (0.2 mg/l) is required to prevent re-contamination in pipes.
Water Supply,"""Turbidity"" refers to the cloudiness of water.",TRUE,It is caused by suspended particles.
Water Supply,Ferrule is a device used to connect a service pipe to the water main.,TRUE,It is inserted into the main pipe.
Water Supply,Boiling is the most effective method of sterilization for household water.,TRUE,It kills almost all pathogens.
Sanitary Engineering,Sewage contains about 99.9% solids and 0.1% water.,FALSE,It is the opposite: 99.9% water and 0.1% solids.
Sanitary Engineering,"A ""Water Seal"" in traps prevents foul gases from entering the house.",TRUE,The water barrier stops gases from the sewer line.
Sanitary Engineering,BOD stands for Biochemical Oxygen Demand.,TRUE,It measures the oxygen needed by bacteria to decompose organic matter.
Sanitary Engineering,"A ""Combined System"" carries both sewage and rainwater in the same pipe.",TRUE,"""Separate System"" uses two different pipes."
Sanitary Engineering,Septic tanks function on the principle of Aerobic decomposition.,FALSE,They function on Anaerobic decomposition (without oxygen).
Sanitary Engineering,A Manhole is usually provided at every bend in a sewer line.,TRUE,To allow access for cleaning and inspection.
Sanitary Engineering,"""Sullage"" includes waste from toilets.",FALSE,Sullage is liquid waste from kitchen/bath only. Waste from toilets is Sewage/Blackwater.
Sanitary Engineering,The minimum diameter for a public sewer is typically 150mm (15cm).,TRUE,Anything smaller is prone to blockage.
Sanitary Engineering,Fresh sewage is usually acidic in nature.,FALSE,Fresh sewage is Alkaline; it becomes acidic as it becomes stale/septic.
Sanitary Engineering,"A ""Vent Pipe"" is provided to release gases from the septic tank/sewer.",TRUE,It prevents back-pressure and releases foul smells high up.
Highway Engineering,"""Camber"" is the longitudinal slope of the road.",FALSE,Camber is the Transverse (cross) slope for drainage. Longitudinal is Gradient.
Highway Engineering,Super-elevation is provided on curves to counteract centrifugal force.,TRUE,It raises the outer edge to keep vehicles on the road.
Highway Engineering,Rigid pavements are made of bituminous materials.,FALSE,Rigid pavements are made of Cement Concrete. Flexible are made of Bitumen.
Highway Engineering,"The ""Shoulder"" serves as an emergency lane for broken-down vehicles.",TRUE,It is the strip alongside the carriageway.
Highway Engineering,CBR (California Bearing Ratio) test is done on bitumen.,FALSE,CBR is done on Sub-grade soil to test its strength.
Highway Engineering,Stopping Sight Distance (SSD) is always greater than Overtaking Sight Distance (OSD).,FALSE,OSD is always greater than SSD because you need more space to pass.
