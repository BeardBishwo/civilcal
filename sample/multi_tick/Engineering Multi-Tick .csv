Hydraulics,Which of the following are properties of fluids?,Viscosity,Density,Surface Tension,Hardness,"A, B, C",Hardness is a property of solids/minerals. The others are fluid properties.
Hydraulics,Which devices are used to measure fluid pressure?,Manometer,Barometer,Piezometer,Thermometer,"A, B, C",Thermometer measures temperature. The others measure pressure.
Hydraulics,Identify the types of fluid flow.,Laminar Flow,Turbulent Flow,Steady Flow,Brittle Flow,"A, B, C","""Brittle"" refers to material failure, not fluid flow."
Hydraulics,Which of the following are types of pumps?,Centrifugal Pump,Reciprocating Pump,Pelton Wheel,Gear Pump,"A, B, D","Pelton Wheel is a Turbine (generates power), not a Pump (consumes power)."
Hydraulics,Major and minor losses in pipe flow are caused by:,Friction,Sudden Enlargement,Bends/Elbows,Fluid Color,"A, B, C",Color does not affect energy loss. Friction is major; bends/expansion are minor.
Concrete Technology,Which tests are performed on fresh concrete?,Slump Test,Compaction Factor Test,Vee-Bee Test,Rebound Hammer Test,"A, B, C",Rebound Hammer is a non-destructive test for hardened concrete.
Concrete Technology,Methods of curing concrete include:,Ponding,Sprinkling,Steam Curing,Burning,"A, B, C",Burning would destroy the concrete. Curing keeps it moist/warm.
Concrete Technology,Which of these are chemical admixtures?,Accelerators,Retarders,Plasticizers,Aggregates,"A, B, C","Aggregates are a main ingredient (sand/gravel), not an admixture."
Concrete Technology,Factors affecting the strength of concrete include:,Water-Cement Ratio,Age of Concrete,Compaction,Brand of Mixer,"A, B, C",The brand of the machine doesn't matter as long as the mixing is thorough.
Concrete Technology,Which of these are types of Cement?,Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC),Rapid Hardening Cement,Pozzolana Portland Cement (PPC),Bitumen,"A, B, C","Bitumen is a binding material for roads (asphalt), not cement."
Water Supply,Sources of water supply include:,Rivers,Lakes,Groundwater (Wells),Sewers,"A, B, C","Sewers carry wastewater, which is not a direct source of potable supply."
Water Supply,Processes involved in water treatment include:,Sedimentation,Filtration,Disinfection (Chlorination),Digestion,"A, B, C","Digestion (sludge digestion) is part of sewage treatment, not water treatment."
Water Supply,Common materials for water supply pipes are:,Cast Iron (CI),Galvanized Iron (GI),PVC,Bamboo,"A, B, C",Bamboo is occasionally used in rural temporary setups but is not a standard engineering material for mains.
Water Supply,Types of valves used in pipe networks:,Sluice Valve,Scour Valve,Air Relief Valve,Heart Valve,"A, B, C",Heart valve is biological.
Water Supply,Physical characteristics of water include:,Turbidity,Color,Temperature,pH Value,"A, B, C","pH is a Chemical characteristic. Turbidity, Color, Temp are Physical."
Sanitary Engineering,Which of the following are sewer appurtenances?,Manhole,Catch Basin,Lamp Hole,Water Tap,"A, B, C","A tap is a water supply fixture, not a sewer appurtenance."
Sanitary Engineering,Gases produced in a septic tank include:,Methane (CH4​),Hydrogen Sulphide (H2​S),Carbon Dioxide (CO2​),Oxygen (O2​),"A, B, C",Septic tanks are anaerobic (no oxygen). Methane is the primary gas.
Sanitary Engineering,Types of Traps used in plumbing:,P-Trap,S-Trap,Gully Trap,Mouse Trap,"A, B, C",Mouse trap is for pest control. The others prevent foul gases.
Sanitary Engineering,Methods of sewage disposal include:,Dilution (in rivers),Land Treatment (Irrigation),Oxidation Ponds,Bottling,"A, B, C",You definitely don't bottle sewage.
Sanitary Engineering,Shapes of sewers can be:,Circular,Egg-shaped,Rectangular,Triangular,"A, B, C",Triangular is not a standard hydraulic shape for sewers. Egg-shaped maintains velocity at low flow.
Highway Engineering,Elements of a road cross-section include:,Carriageway,Camber,Shoulder,Foundation,"A, B, C","Foundation is a structural layer below, not a surface cross-section geometric element like the others."
Highway Engineering,Which of these are tests on Bitumen?,Penetration Test,Ductility Test,Softening Point Test,Slump Test,"A, B, C",Slump test is for Concrete.
Highway Engineering,Types of road pavements are:,Flexible Pavement,Rigid Pavement,Semi-rigid Pavement,Liquid Pavement,"A, B, C",Pavements must be solid to support traffic.
Highway Engineering,Common road defects/failures include:,Pot Holes,Rutting,Cracks,Smoothness,"A, B, C","Smoothness is a desired quality, not a defect."
Highway Engineering,Traffic control devices include:,Traffic Signs,Traffic Signals,Road Markings,Traffic Police,"A, B, C","While Police control traffic, they are personnel, not ""devices""."
