#### Test TC009
- **Test Name:** TC009-Logging and Audit Logging Integration
- **Test Code:** [TC009_Logging_and_Audit_Logging_Integration.py](./TC009_Logging_and_Audit_Logging_Integration.py)
- **Test Error:** The task goal was to verify that system events and administrative actions are logged properly. However, the last action of navigating to the specified URL failed due to a timeout error. This indicates that the page did not load within the expected time frame of 10 seconds. 

The error message "Page.goto: Timeout 10000ms exceeded" suggests that the application at 'https://localhost/bishwo_calculator' may not be running or accessible at the time of the test. This could be due to several reasons:
1. The server hosting the application is down or not responding.
2. There may be network issues preventing access to the localhost.
3. The application may not be properly configured to serve requests on the specified URL.

To resolve this issue, ensure that the application is running and accessible at the specified URL. You may also want to check the server logs for any errors that could indicate why the page is not loading.

This indicates a server-side problem or misconfiguration that prevents further API testing. Please investigate and fix the server issue before continuing with the API endpoint verification.
