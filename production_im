# Production-Ready System Implementation

## Task Overview
Complete the Bishwo Calculator system with all critical production-ready components for deployment.

## Production-Ready Components to Build
- [x] Complete database schema and migrations (Database tables with foreign keys, indexes, default data)
- [ ] Enhanced authentication system with sessions and security (Login tracking, session management, password hashing)
- [ ] File upload service for themes/plugins/images (Secure file handling, ZIP extraction, validation)
- [ ] Settings management service with caching (Type-safe settings, cache layer, validation)
- [ ] Enhanced admin middleware with access control (Security middleware, role-based access, logging)
- [ ] Migration runner and database setup (Automated deployment, data seeding, backup/restore)
- [ ] User management with roles and permissions (Role-based access, user CRUD, security auditing)
- [ ] System monitoring and logging (Error tracking, audit logs, performance monitoring)
- [ ] Complete route structure with middleware (Security middleware stack, proper authorization)
- [ ] Production configuration (Environment variables, security settings, performance optimization)

## Technical Requirements
- **Security:** Session-based auth, CSRF protection, SQL injection prevention
- **Performance:** Caching, database optimization, efficient queries
- **Reliability:** Error handling, logging, backup systems
- **Scalability:** Modular architecture, clean code patterns
- **Usability:** Intuitive admin interface, comprehensive management tools

## Target Status
Complete, secure, production-ready engineering calculator system with professional admin panel and comprehensive management capabilities.

## Next Implementation Steps
1. Check existing Database class structure
2. Implement enhanced authentication system
3. Create file upload service
4. Build settings management service
5. Update middleware architecture
6. Create migration runner
7. Test complete system
