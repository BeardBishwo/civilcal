# Production-Ready System Implementation

## Task Overview
Complete the Bishwo Calculator system with all critical production-ready components for deployment.

## Production-Ready Components to Build
- [x] Complete database schema and migrations (Database tables with foreign keys, indexes, default data)
- [x] Enhanced authentication system with sessions and security (Login tracking, session management, password hashing)
- [x] File upload service for themes/plugins/images (Secure file handling, ZIP extraction, validation)
- [x] Settings management service with caching (Type-safe settings, cache layer, validation)
- [x] Migration runner and database setup (Automated deployment, data seeding, backup/restore)
- [x] User management with roles and permissions (Role-based access, user CRUD, security auditing)
- [x] System monitoring and logging (Error tracking, audit logs, performance monitoring)
- [x] Complete route structure with middleware (Security middleware stack, proper authorization)
- [x] Production configuration (Environment variables, security settings, performance optimization)
- [x] Complete comprehensive admin panel (Dashboard, users, calculators, modules, themes, plugins, settings, email, subscriptions, help & logs)
- [x] Calculator engine and core system (Factory pattern, validation, calculation service)
- [x] User-facing calculator interface (Categories, tools, responsive design)
- [x] User profile and history system (Profile management, calculation history, settings)
- [x] RESTful API system (Endpoints, authentication, rate limiting)
- [ ] Public website and homepage (Marketing pages, features, pricing)
- [ ] Frontend views and layouts (Bootstrap templates, responsive design)
- [ ] Complete route configuration (All endpoints, middleware protection)
- [ ] Production deployment scripts (Automated setup, SSL, monitoring)
- [ ] Environment configuration (Production settings, security hardening)
