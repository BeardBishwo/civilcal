WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
================================================================================

Your app has 10 problems. All are related to the DATABASE not being set up.

Think of it like this:
- Your app = A restaurant
- Database = The kitchen
- Problem = The kitchen isn't ready yet

Solution: Set up the kitchen (database) first!

================================================================================
QUICK SUMMARY OF WHAT TO DO
================================================================================

1. Open Command Prompt (Windows Key + R, type "cmd")
2. Go to your project folder
3. Run: php database/migrate.php
4. Run: php tests/database/check_db.php
5. Restart Laragon (Stop then Start)
6. Run the tests again

That's it! Takes about 15 minutes.

================================================================================
