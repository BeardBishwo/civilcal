# FINAL QA REPORT: Enterprise Pipeline Sign-Off

**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Status:** ✅ GO FOR PRODUCTION
**Environment:** Enterprise Acceptance Sandbox

## Executive Summary
All "Master Protocol" objectives have been met. The application has successfully transitioned to a unified **Enterprise Pipeline Architecture**. API endpoints are optimized, virtual engines are stable, and the "Enterprise Value Chain" (Materials, Cost, Suggestions) is fully operational in the backend.

## 1. Frontend & API Acceptance
| Requirement | Status | Verification Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Modern `/api/calculate` endpoint | ✅ PASS | Verified JSON response via direct API call. |
| Legacy `/modules/` removal | ✅ PASS | Confirmed Router redirection and cleanup. |
| Enterprise JSON Structure | ✅ PASS | Physics + Enterprise (Materials, Cost, Suggestions) validated. |
| Absolute Asset Paths | ✅ PASS | Verified `APP_BASE_URL` integration in frontend JS. |

## 2. Enterprise Logic & Chain Reactions
| Tool | Result (Physics) | Enterprise Result (Chain) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Concrete Calculator** | Accurate Volume/Area | Bill of Materials (BOM) + Cost + Shuttering Suggestion. |
| **Brick Wall Calculator** | Accurate Vol/Area | BOM + Cost + **Autotrigger Suggestions (Plaster/Paint)**. |
| **Ohm's Law (Virtual)** | Accurate V=IR | Stable execution via Virtual Engine (No physical module). |

## 3. Infrastructure & Architecture Audit
- **Class-Based Engine**: Successfully resolving `App\Calculators\{Category}\{Class}`.
- **Virtual Config Engine**: Stable fallback for electrical tools using `App\Config\Calculators`.
- **Suggestion Engine**: Verified data pre-fill capability for sequential calculations.
- **Autoloading**: PHP Autoloader correctly mapping namespaces to physical files.

## GO/NO-GO Recommendation
**RECOMMENDATION: GO**
The system is architecturally sound, statistically accurate, and enterprise-ready. No blockers found.
